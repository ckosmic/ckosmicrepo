		Short description: Turns the screen's brightness to 100% when using the camera app.

		Interesting description: Have you ever been to a concert and wondered why some people's phone cameras look so much better than yours?  Most of the time, it's because it's an Android and they have a feature where the screen's brightness gets turned all the way up to get a clearer shot.  This tweak does just that.  Opening the default camera app whether it be from the lock screen or the home screen will turn the screen's brightness to 100% and restore it once the app is closed.
